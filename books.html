  <h2>Book List Overview</h2>

  <p>Books are awesome, so much wisdom and adventure condensed down to a few hundred pages! This list only includes the books I have personally read. 
    It’s roughly ordered, starting with my favorite books on top, but please take the order with a grain of salt. A life-changing book for one person can 
    be worthless to another. A book has an impact on someone if the concepts are novel to them and they can internalize the concepts. I will trust that you 
    will adapt the ranking to your life accordingly. </p>
  <p>I don’t usually take notes when reading a book so I apologize for my sparse thoughts on each book below. 
    The number of notes, or lack of notes, is no indication of the quality of the book. I prefer to get lost while reading, pondering concepts and 
    letting my mind run, then applying the concepts, with the hope that they become an integral part of who I am. Or at least that’s my excuse for why I 
    can’t remember the takeaways from a specific book by the title. </p>
