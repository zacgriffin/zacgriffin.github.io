  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    After finishing a house remodel around Q2 2021, I finally got around to building out my 2020 Ford Transit. 
    The internet covered most of the heavy lifting as it had been accumulating modern camper van builds since roughly 2006. 
    FarOutRide, bless their souls, provides an amazing resource at the best possible price, free.
    Check them out for build details and please use their affiliate links when possible! 
    Always enjoying a challenge, I required that my build have all the conveniences of a house while also being off-grid capable for over a week.
    The van is roughly 90% complete. I'm holding off on trim and finish until it's had enough field testing to ensure no major changes are needed.
    We'll start with a quick van tour and then touch on a few of the build details.

    All camper van conversions start with deciding on the base van. 
    This ended up being an easy decision as my design requirements - to have all the conveniences of a house while also being off-grid capable for over a week - left me with only three realistic options due to space and weight requirements. 
    I could get an extended-length Ford Transit dually, a wide wheelbase Mercedez Sprinter dually, or a specialty vehicle (school bus, Southwest snack truck, etc.).
    I ruled out the specialty vehicle as I would be spending a material amount of time in civilization and didn't want the added attention.
    The used market for duallys was non-existent so I reluctantly hiked over to my local car dealerships for some harassment.
    I checked out both the transit and sprinter and felt the sprinter was a more impressive vehicle but couldn't justify the price disparity.
    I ended up getting an extended-length 2020 Ford Transit dually and am still happy with that choice.

  <p>
    After letting the van sit for a few months at a storage warehouse while I finished up a home remodel, I finally got to work on the conversion. 
    I moved the van to a covered warehouse full of tools and set up a desk 5 feet away. This was my home, office, and gym for the next four months. 
    From previous lives, I found this setup the fastest way to iterate on a project that is both being designed and built simultaneously. 
    I never found the front of the ford transits very aesthetically pleasing but the roof rack makes it look slightly better. 
    That said, you can see everything plus more with the massive front windshield and the short nose makes parking easy.
  </p>

  <p>
    I looked around for a roof rack and ladder for the van and had three issues with the products on the market.
    The prices were insulting, the lead times were laughable and the aesthetics were average at best.
    So I built my own. I was very happy with how the roof rack turned out and wouldn't make any changes.
    For the ladder, I should have added another bend roughly three feet from the top. I don't think the gap looks tacky, but I think the pointy aluminum bend does. 
    After having tested the ladder, I second-guessed my ladder alignment and level with respect to the van and made some modifications to fix what I perceived to be the issue.
    After making the modifications, the same problem was still there! Turns out, I had the ladder correctly built, just not mounted correctly the first time, and ruined the alignment with the modifications. 
    Yeah, it was dumb. I was pretty upset with myself for a few days.
    Even with those two mistakes, I still think the ladder turned out awesome and wouldn't change my original decision to build it myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    I looked around for window covers and found aesthetically appealing options but with high price tags and unacceptable lead times so I ended up making these myself too. 
    My design requirements were that they fold for easy storage, provide total privacy, are quick to put up and take down and provide heat transfer resistance similar to the rest of my van.
    There is disagreement online about the heat transfer resistance of reflective insulation on window covers with many van lifers playing armchair physicists. 
    With nothing convincing online, I did a quick, unscientific test that's probably not applicable.
    On a cloudless sunny spring day in Texas, a volume of air behind just glass got to 88F, while the same volume of air behind fabric with glass on top got to 82F and the same volume of air behind reflective insulation with glass on top only got to 75F.
    I interpreted these results to mean that I needed two sets of window covers, 6 total, 2 for each window. 
    One set is made with reflective insulation and one set is 1/2-inch XPS rigid foam board slats stitched into 8.7 oz ripstop polyester.
    For times when heat transfer isn't a big deal, I just toss up the fabric-coated covers. Other times, the reflective insulation goes up first, then the fabric covers behind.
    Now to have a look at that roof rack.

    I've got a few things on the roof. The antenna sticking up in the foreground is a WeBoost signal booster.
    I would categorize this as a nice to have but not necessary feature but with my internet addiction, it was a must. 
    That big box sitting on the roof behind the signal booster is a Coleman Mach 10 NDQ air conditioner. 
    I almost skimped and bought a cheaper model but eventually forked over the cash assuming I would appreciate it being quiet and energy-efficient. 
    Second best decision I made on the van and would gladly pay an even higher price differential in the future.  
    I sometimes live in Texas where it's miserably hot and humid most of the year and AC is a must.
    The unit has worked great since installation, but planning was impossible.
    Their technical documents are missing information and every customer service agent will tell you something different. 
    I tried other RV rooftop AC companies and found them to be even worse. 
    I built roof adapters (transition from the curved roof surface to flat for the AC foam mount) out of expanded PVC. You can buy them but I thought they were way overpriced.
    Those white platforms are 3/4 plywood coated with deck paint. I use them to walk on the roof and clean the solar panels or as bases to strap down cargo.
    I wanted aluminum grating but prices were unreal, not to mention you couldn't get them even if you had the money.
  </p>

  <p>
    Near the back are four 100W solar panels. 
    The two on the left are wired in series and the two on the right are wired in series, then the left group is wired in parallel with the right group (2S2P).
    I bought HQST solar panels and planned on a 4S (all in series) configuration based on the technical specs they provided and listed on the panels I received.
    However, this was dashed when I tested the actual Open Circuit Voltage (Voc) at >23.80V. The listed open-circuit voltage (Voc) on the product is 21.6V.
    This would have exceeded my charge controllerâ€™s ratings so I changed to the 2S2P setup. 
    As another note on HQST quality, the actual performance of the panels, on average, was only 92W versus the claimed 100W. 
    No one likes shade getting thrown their way, especially solar panels. I chose the solar panel locations and dimensions to eliminate shade thrown by other objects on the roof.
    That little hill on the back between the solar panels is a MaxxFan. On to the inside!

  <p>
    You are currently looking into the main cabin which is split by a walkway. 
    All the water infrastructure is on the driver's side and the propane infrastructure is on the passenger side. 
    In the back, at the end of the walkway, is a raised bed with a garage underneath. 
    Let's start on the water side.
    Behind the driver's seat, we have a shower that doubles as storage when an outside shower is available. 
    It's currently in shower mode but you will likely see the removable shelves later.
    I built the shower so I could stand up straight while keeping all of the water above the van floor 
    (I didn't want to worry about freezing and I wanted the van to be fully contained).
    To achieve this, you'll need a low-profile elbow drain. 
    The Scandvik 10307 I bought came with typical drain openings so I bought a drain protector and attached some 80-mesh stainless steel over it.
    I was clogging the pump filter every few days before and I was tired of cleaning it. Much easier with the removable drain protector in the shower.
    The drain line goes under the cabinet to the left, into a pump beneath the sink, and into a grey water tank beneath the sink.
    Initially, I thought I was a tough guy who could manage room temperature showers and didn't install a hot water heater. 
    Yeah, well, turns out I like hot showers and installed one. The extended shower curtain rod is also a must. 
    I opted for a normal flow shower head with an on/off button. The company I bought mine from calls it a pause button, I assume for legal protection if it fails. 
    Standard wall-mounted soap dispenser in the corner.
  </p>

  <p>
    To the left of the shower is a full-height cabinet. On the bottom is a pull-out drawer. 
    This usually houses food but also occasionally ends up with miscellaneous items.
    On top of that is the fridge. You see that dent in the top panel? I initially thought my cutout would keep the fridge from falling out of its house but it wasn't.
    While hitting a small bump on a turn at Glacier National Park, the fridge levitated, hovered out of the enclosure and kissed the oven. 
    Needless to say, I broke that romance up on the next pullout. Save your future self from looking at a dented fridge every day by installing a board in front of the fridge feet from day one.
    That is a 4.3 cubic foot fridge/freezer but I would have gone bigger if I had the space. I eat roughly five thousand calories a day though so take the bigger fridge comment in context.
    On top is a medium-sized cabinet. It has a shelf roughly in the middle. A microwave sits on the top shelf. 
    Remember how I thought I could live without hot water? Well, I thought I could live without a microwave as well.
    On the lower shelf is food. Mostly cereal because that stuff is delicious. 
    To the left of the full-height cabinet is the sink area, which is mostly hidden by the stove.
  </p>
  
  <figure class="figure-img">
    <img class="img-fluid singleArticlePicture" " src="/images/camperside.jpg" alt="View of the sink in Zac's 2020 Ford Transit">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center mt-2">View of the sink in Zac's 2020 Ford Transit</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Ahhh, not hidden anymore. I wish that dent would hide behind something though.
    Bathroom things and cleaning supplies hide under the sink along with the shower pump and grey water tank.
    That hose you see is the shower drain line. There is a lot of unused space under the sink. 
    Next time I have some free time (which never happens), I will build shelving so I can have more space.
    That is a fake drawer on top. I installed the countertop before attaching the handle. Big mistake and I can't remember how I attached it. Still holding on though. 
    Everyone online (correctly) says granite is a poor choice for RV countertop material. A friend had some scraps laying around, and I like granite, so thatâ€™s what got installed.
    My first time working with granite and I went through the full range of emotions. "Worst idea ever, this sucks, I'm never going to make this work" to "That was so easy, cakewalk".
    The seventeen-inch sink drains into the grey water tank through a flex hose.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've installed six faucets in the last year or so, all of them being Flow Motion brand faucets. They are great motion-activated faucets at a reasonable price and I never saw any downsides. 
    Unless a fly or other insect happens to pass in front of the motion sensor in the middle of the night and the emergency cutoff doesn't trigger until your 40 gallon
    freshwater tank has been pumped into your seven gallon grey water tank and the excess onto the van floor.
    Partially true story. The pump woke me up when it turned on and I snapped out of my sleep stupor before the grey water tank was half full. I now religiously use the handle.
    Those are wall-mounted soap dispensers. Really happy with them so far although most people on Amazon don't seem to have had as good of an experience. 
    You can barely see the edge of the black drying towel. It's got a wall mount to the left of the soap dispensers high enough to keep it from touching the countertop. 
    Above the drying towel is a wall-mounted trash can. Well, really, it's a sanitary receptacle for female products but works great as a trash can.
    If you are a guy and want to know what I am talking about, visit a climbing gym and check out the restroom. That bin on the wall thatâ€™s not getting used, yeah, that's it. 
    Above the sink is a mirror so I can check out my bedhead and wonder how I got so ugly. Now for the propane side.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sorry for the appearance of the finger. It happens to want in on pictures every now and then. 
    The butcher block countertop mounted on the left side of the oven cabinet was homemade out of white oak scraps. 
    Fairly easy project until you try to glue and clamp the slats together while keeping everything aligned and level. Spoiler, it doesn't happen. 
    No problem though, you'll just run it through your 16" planar. Too bad some idiot made it 18" wide?! Rookie. 
    The countertop mainly functions as a dinner table but comes in handy fairly often.
    I found the folding angles on Amazon and have been happy with them. 
    The only downside was I had to put padding on the levers as they rubbed the side of my cabinet when the table was down. It took me longer to find the neoprene than to put it on.
  </p>

  <p>
    The folding table is attached to the oven cabinet. Below the oven is a small cabinet that stores food and tupperware.
    The propane line runs along the back of the cabinet and connects to the oven's flex line. 
    Of all the things in my van, people have deemed the oven the most adorable. 
    When not in use, I store my pots and pans in it. The oven works great but getting it to light can test my patience sometimes.
    That's probably my fault though since I only skimmed the manual. Not sure why the control knobs light up, but they do if you press that little white button. 
    The glass on top covers the three burners and extends your countertop space when not in use. Pull it back to use the burners.
    I haven't completely understood the burners yet. Two usually always work, but one usually has issues lighting. 
    It's never the same one though and rotates every time I use it. I've come to think of it as a game.
  </p>

  <p>
    To the right of the oven is a storage cabinet. Installed under the cabinet is a Propex HS2000 heater. 
    That guy is a nasty electrical vampire so make sure he gets a switch unless you want to pull the fuse. 
    You can see the black outlet cover which provides that oh-so-warm air in the winter. 
    The storage cabinet mostly contains more food on both shelves. I told you I eat a lot right?
    There is also some propane piping in the back of that cabinet. 
    The drawer works on this cabinet and acts as a utility and kitchen drawer. 
    That's another countertop made out of granite. Much easier than the sink though, no inside edges and corners. 
    That little guy in the back corner is the transmitter for the signal booster. 
  </p>

  <p>
    A few inches above the countertop is an outlet bank with light switches and plugs.
    I promise that the 120V power strip is temporary. I should have installed 120V outlets next to the 12V and 5V outlets and used a 3-gang box. Right now it is a 2 gang, one light switch and the other is a 12V and 5V mixed outlet.  
    To the right of the storage cabinet and underneath the bed is another storage shelf. 
    I left it open to allow air exchange between the main cabin and garage even though it's not currently doing that with all the clean clothes stuffed in it.
    All the shelves are removable but so far, I haven't taken any of them out. Various things end up on this shelf as the clothes dirty themselves.
    On the bottom shelf is a 2,000W Renogy inverter. It claims a 4,000W peak but anytime it's chilly and I'm peaking near 2,000W, it faults. 
    Below the inverter is my battery bank.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next shelf over is my hot water shelf and it sits below my main 120V electrical outlets. 
    All the large amp draw, 120V appliances - hot water heater, battery charger, microwave, air conditioner - 
    end up here with plugs and they can be hooked up to either the top power strip which is shore powered or the lower power strip which is powered by the inverter. 
    I double-checked my voltage and power consumption to make sure everything would work and it wouldn't burn down the van. So far, so good.
    I use the top shelf for temporary storage and it looks like my alignment adjuster for my Microsoft Sculpt keyboard is currently hanging out there.
    It may look off-putting at first, but I highly recommend the Microsoft Sculpt keyboard and mouse, one of the best purchases I ever made. 
    Whatever items I happen to be using that day usually end up in front of the hot water heater. Looks like that day was a coding day. 
    Bottom shelf, dirty laundry. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I pondered aisle width for quite a while. Granite to granite, 25 inches. Cabinet handle to cabinet handle, 24.25 inches. Oven handle to fridge, 23.5 inches. 
    Really happy with that spacing. Big enough to be comfortable but also maximizes cabinet space. 
  </p>

  </figure>

  <p>
    Ug, that dent in the fridge follows me everywhere. Looking at the roof, I installed half-inch plywood along each one of the roof supports. The ceiling will eventually screw into these.
    For now, I mounted the LEDs to them on temporary slats. I went with eight lights in the van and think that is a good number.
    The lighting in the cockpit area is a little dim but not bad enough to fix it now. I will likely build brackets and install a custom headliner. 
    I'll mount two recessed lights in the headliner when it's built. 
  </p>
    
  <p>
    That white box between the first and second roof support is an air distribution box for the air conditioner. Technically the Airxcel 81-0980 Bluetooth Heat Ready Air Distribution Box.
    It's the Bluetooth one and despite all the negative reviews, I haven't had any complaints. 
    Search "Coleman-Mach Bluetooth Ceiling Assembly Installation" on YouTube and use the Airxcel video if you want a better guide than the written instructions. 
    I am really happy with the install location for the AC, access is easy and it is far enough from my bed that it doesn't wake me up at night when the compressor cycles. 
    On low, at an armâ€™s length distance the unit is roughly 56dB and on high at the same distance, it is roughly 60dB.
    In front and behind the unit you can see a little bit of the interior roof supports I build. 
    I cut 3 slats of 3/4 inch plywood for each side for a total of 12 slats with the edge mating to the roof contours. Then glued those bad boys to the roof.
    Hasn't fallen off yet.
    Way in the back of the van you can see the inside portion of the MaxxFan. 
    Two wires come through the ceiling. One for the signal booster between the second and third supports and another for the solar panels between the third and fourth supports.
    On the wall near the back of the van, there is a wire bundle that can't be relocated. It's really a buzz kill to an otherwise peaceful wall.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's start with the floating bed then work our way left to right. 
    The legs for the platform bed are two sheets of half-inch plywood mounted on both walls that go from the floor to the ceiling. 
    I call this a floating bed because rather than have obvious and dedicated feet, it is attached to the wall and appears to float. 
    Although I liked this look better than most other builds, I did sacrifice space to achieve the look.
    The interior width of Ford Transits decreases as you move higher vertically with a decently abrupt change at about the height of my bed.
    FarOutRide and others build with the bed under this protrusion saving some space.
    Back to the build. Two beautiful oak runners were then screwed to the wall plywood. 
    I stained these "smoke grey" but Miniwax is obviously color blind because they are brown as you can see in the picture.  
    I then ran 1x2 inch clear coated rectangular steel tubing as spans across the runners. 
    I tested 1x1 inch steel tubing and it would likely work, but it flexed too much for me. 
    I would recommend using metal as bed supports as wood will sag over time. 
    I lined the female cutouts with neoprene and the resulting press fit was oh so satisfying. 
    I put neoprene on the top of the steel tubing and laid plywood on top.
    The side rails on top of the plywood are screwed from underneath to hold the bed in place.   
  </p>

  <p>
    On the far left of the garage is the water system. 
    It starts with a 40 gallon tank sitting on a wheel well covered in a plywood box. 
    I am happy with the size of the water tank but next time I would look for ports on opposing sides and a water outlet on the bottom of the tank to allow complete drainage.
    Next to the 40 gallon water tank is a 2.5 gallon hot water heater sitting on a shelf. Perfect size for a quick warm shower. I use the space underneath for dirty clothes. 
    Two long drawers in the middle of the garage keep from having stranded area. 
    The drawer on the right isn't installed in this picture and the top of the propane box is holding its place. 
    Behind the propane top is the battery bank, inverter, and shelving unit. That box on the right is a sealed locker for a propane tank. 
    The propane lines go from that tank into the propane side cabinets.  
    Hiding behind the propane tank is the electrical area. 
  </p>

    <img class="img-fluid singleArticlePicture" " src="/images/camperelectronics.jpg" alt="View of the electronics cave from Zac's 2020 Ford Transit">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center mt-2">View of the electronics cave from Zac's 2020 Ford Transit</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The foundation of the electric system is 900Ah of CHINS Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries hiding underneath the white shelves. 
    Overkill most of the time but running a microwave, taking hot showers, or using AC while off the grid was worth it for me.
    I still haven't tested the batteries and some people have reported issues (like low voltage cutoff not working).
    I would expect these batteries to be similar to the solar panels I purchased - not quite perfect but the best value deal. 
    The positive side goes through a fuse and main switch to the positive bus bar. The negative side does through a shunt and into the negative bus bar. 
    The bus bars are hidden behind the propane locker but all this occurs on top of the wheel well plywood box. 
    I would have preferred to keep the propane line further away from electrical equipment but I couldn't find an acceptable trade-off. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Stepping through the wall-mounted equipment on the storage cabinet wall inside the cave there is a 12v power strip for low power appliances.
    Attached to this is a 5v power strip for even lower power applications. If you read the warning labels on power strips, it is not good practice to daisy chain. 
    Why did I do it then? I double-checked power ratings and I am materially below their rated values. The entire 5V power strip draws 11W with 4 components connected.
    The 12V power strip is drawing 23W + 11W = 34W total. Both are fused. Ignore warnings at your own peril. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The larger electrical components are located on the van wall. Moving left to right, on the bottom left, the signal booster amplifier is barely visible.
    It is the red heat exchanger with a black band across the middle. A little up and to the right is a silver box which is my 60 amp battery charger.
    I wanted to go with a larger model but Progressive Dynamics wanted a 20 amp breaker on the next step up and I couldn't guarantee that.
    The white box with a red bottom cover next to the battery charger is a battery-to-battery charger. 
    This little guy lets you charge your house batteries using your van's alternator when you are driving. I got the 60 amp version. 
    If I did my build over again, I wouldn't install one because I rarely need to charge while driving and the distance between my starter battery and house batteries makes the wire sizing outrageously expensive and annoying.
    Great idea and product if you plan better than me and actually use it. 
    That blue box to the right is the solar charger. Basically takes the electricity from the solar panels and makes it into the form batteries like. 
    Then to the right of the solar charger is two 12v fuse blocks. 
    All the appliances less than 30A get wired through these and the appropriate fuse inserted for protection.
  </p>

    Here is the van loaded prior to a trip. I left a little gap between the rear doors and bed platform to hang long, skinny items, like my dress clothes.
    I haven't used these yet but I feel obligated to have the ability to look nice in the event I get called out. My preference is t-shirts and running shorts. 
    I originally had a 9-inch-tall mattress which matched the side rails perfectly. But then I bought a new mattress which was 11 inches tall and here we are. 
    I could sit in bed without hitting my head when I had the 9-inch-tall mattress. With the 11 incher, I have to carefully sit up to not hit my head. 
    Marching left to right. Two boxes containing tools. A few more tools hide behind those boxes. 
    The main purpose of the left drawer slide is to hold my bike. I fill the extra space with other items like two fairly empty boxes for future storage. That is my mid-size backpack to the right of the boxes.
    A water tank for filling my main water tank if a tap isn't available, which is hidden behind the boxes but you can see the brass valve and flex line. 
    My Instapot is hiding further forward on the drawer slide. Every human being needs one of those. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The right drawer slide was made to house 6 storage boxes. These contain things like climbing gear, winter clothes, and camping gear. 
    I think a few of them are still fairly empty meaning I need to pick up some more hobbies.
    The tire release is under that drawer slide and you can see the beginning of the cutout I made on the drawer slide. 
    Don't cover this up or you may be in a bind when you get a flat. I'll save you the full story, but I got a flat, at midnight, when it was snowing. 
    It was a bad night. To the right is more space where I put random things right now there is a stack of ~7 boxes or so with a moving blanket and my hoses to fill up my water tank. 
    Those white shelves tied together on the wall are the ones that go in the shower. I put a lip on the front to keep stuff from sliding off. This trip I was showering in the van so I had them tied up in the back. 
    See you on the road!

  <p>
    Of all the camper van projects, the roof rack and ladder build was my favorite. 
    Small design projects, metalwork and good cover to buy another welder - now that's an enticing project. 
    To top it off, I think it made the van exterior look a lot better. 
    Similar to the main camper build, I leaned on the internet for the best it had to offer. 
    SuperfastMatt was my favorite and you can check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylPZkwRBA5o">original</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylPZkwRBA5o">improved</a> do-it-yourself roof rack videos for background.
    Now that we are all up to speed, specific details for my roof rack build are below.
  </p>
    <ul class="listp">
      <li>Feet - Eight leveling feet made by welding 5" wide x 1/4" thick 6061-T6511 aluminum plate </li>
      <li>Aero shield - One aero shield cut out of 1/16" 5052-H32 aluminum sheet</li>
      <li>Crossbars - Purchased eighteen full cross bars (probably only needed 15 though) at 65" long EX-1020-BLACK - 1" x 2" BLACK Smooth T-Slotted Aluminum Extrusion </li>
      <li>Side Angle - Cut out of 6061-T6 aluminum, 1/4" thick, 4" x 4" angle </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I'll touch on the aero shield, crossbars, and side angle but most of the time will be spent on the leveling feet as those were the most exciting.
       I didn't spend time searching for ladder builds, so it's just us on this one. Ladder parts below:</p>

    <ul class="listp">
      <li>Side rails - 1.5" x 1" 6063-T52 1/8" thick aluminum rectangular tubing</li>
      <li>Rungs - 1" x 1" 6061T6 1/8" thick aluminum square tubing</li>
      <li>Mounting Plates - Cut from 5" wide x 1/4" thick 6061-T6511 aluminum plate</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When I put all that together, this is what I got: </p>

      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center mt-2">Roof view of Zac's 2020 Ford Transit in the Warehouse</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>It started off less dirty of course. Let's start with the base of the roof rack - the leveling feet. Here are three of them waiting to be painted. </p>

    <figure class="figure-img">
      <img class="img-fluid singleArticlePicture" " src="/images/rrfeetdetail.jpg" alt="Detailed view of the roof rack feet awaiting paint">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center mt-2">Detailed view of the roof rack feet awaiting paint</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>
      Those orange things are earplugs and they are protecting screw holes from getting coated in bed liner (Raptor Lining).
      The leveling feet are made of four individual parts. 
      <ul class="listp">
        <li>Base plate - 4" x 5" rectangle with the two back corners rounded. This mates well with the roof rack mounting points on the van. The single screw secures and holds the foot to the roof. </li>
        <li>Top plate - 5" x 5" square. The 4" angle will sit on the floating side and attach to the leveling feet using the two screw holes in the top plate. I used 1/4-20 hardware and a 1/4" nylon lock nut fits perfectly in between the top and base plates. </li>
        <li>Horizontal wedge - Placed between the base and top plate, near the roof mounting screw. This is a 1/2" long x 5" wide x 1/4" part using the thickness as the height. </li>
        <li>Vertical wedge - Placed between the base and top plate, at the edge of the base plate opposite the roof mounting screw. This is a 7/16" long x 5" wide x "1/4" thick part using the length as the height. </li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>
      The difference between the 1/4" tall horizontal wedge and the 7/16" tall vertical wedge "levels" out the van roof so the 4" angle sits level.
      The 4" angle will align flush with both the floating edge of the top plate and the top corner of the van, as shown in the picture below. 
      I don't mind seeing the feet, but if you wanted to hide these, you could. 
    </p>

    <figure class="figure-img">
      <img class="img-fluid singleArticlePicture" " src="/images/rrfeetinstalled.jpg" alt="View of installed ladder foot">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center mt-2">View of installed ladder foot</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      This was deliberate as I didn't like the aesthetic of most roof racks that were further inside the top corner of the van roof. 
      That is Dicor lap sealant for waterproofing around the leveling feet. I also installed 1/16th inch neoprene between the leveling feet and van roof but it's not visible.
      As added insurance, I used silicone caulk around the screw.  
      For welding the leveling feet, I picked up a Hobart Handler 190 and Hobart Spool Runner then brushed up on my aluminum welding with Miller's online resources.
      After an hour or so of horrible welds, I finally got something reasonable and welded both wedges to the base plate, and then the top plate to both wedges.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the feet were made, I temporarily attached those to the roof and worked on the sides. 
      I bought 25' stock for the 4" angle and cut that into two 12.5'. No waste! 
      For the aero shield mount, I cut a 30-degree angle from horizontal. Measure twice, cut one saved me here, almost hacked off the wrong angle. 
      Only hitting four things on the way to the ladder, I hoisted it up and set it on the feet. 
      Marked the feet locations, then drilled the necessary holes for securing it to the feet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since I had the drill press setup, I also knocked out all the crossbar mounting holes. I chose 12 inches on center, 10 inches between extrusions.
      Starting with the back extrusion flush, this gave me 13 total crossbars, with the front one being ~11 inches on center. Nice!
      I overestimated my shopâ€™s ability to tap holes in the crossbars and ended up taping a good number of them by hand. Should have paid to have them done. Lesson learned. 
      One hundred and sixteen screws later, I had something resembling a roof rack.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center mt-2">Roof Rack without anything mounted</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The last part of the roof rack was the aero shield. 
      I had a 4' x 8' sheet of aluminum so I took more risk than normal. 
      I measured 5 points and bent a thin metal bar to pass through the points, clamping it down one by one. 
      I'd give myself a 92, sufficient but could have been slightly better. 
      I picked up some edging off amazon which helped hide a few nibbles that got away from me. 
      There are two water drains coming off the roof and I figured it would whistle if I let the aero shield hang over them so I took them off.
      Straight-line from the edge of the drain to the roof rack sides. I just assumed this though so maybe I could have left them on? 
      The only picture I took of the aero shield prior to paint was with all the other parts.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      That tape on the aero shield was to keep me from losing any more skin. I had bled enough by this point. 
      That's a wrap for the roof rack so let's move on to the ladder. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      I fabricated two parts to get the ladder on the van, the ladder itself and the bottom mounting plate. Let's do the ladder first.
      Anytime I talk with friends about designing something, they always assume I have some fancy 3D CAD modeling software that propagates light waves using nuclear physics. 
      While I do have fancy calculators, I take the Honda out occasionally. To prove my point, I wanted to design the ladder in PowerPoint (admittedly, I did check mechanical integrity in excel).
      As an aside, getting the PowerPoint screenshot into this article without pixelation was annoying.  
    </p>

    <figure class="figure-img">
      <img class="img-fluid singleArticlePicture" src="/images/rrladderdesign.png" alt="PowerPoint aided design for ladder">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center mt-2">PowerPoint aided design for ladder</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      That is a scaled version of the ladder in PowerPoint, which just barely fits all the way zoomed out with the ribbon collapsed. 
      The first thing I did was set up a long steel pipe touching the outermost point of the van as a reference vertical and leveled it in both x and y. 
      I then measured the distance from the vertical to my van wall. Then you take the largest value measured and subtract that from your measured values.
      Plotting those values gave me the outline of my van wall. I've seen some fancy 3D scanners but I don't own one yet. Soon.
      I wanted to average ~6 inches from the van surface which is the red lines. The actual ladder ended up fairly close. 
      I then iterated with lengths and angles of the side rail until I got something that looked reasonable. 
      It wasn't necessary to keep all the angles at 21 degrees and 3 degrees but it made cutting out parts much easier as angle adjustments on my horizontal bandsaw take a minute or two.
      For the ladder rung spacing, I consulted a ladder that happened to be nearby and found the rung to rung spacing was 10 1/8" and the rungs were 12" on center.
      I took the middle road and did 10.5" between rungs and 11.5" on center, which also coincided nicely with the total ladder length. 
      On the top and bottom, I welded on a 1/4" plate to serve as the mounting face, four screws per face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Welding all the pieces together without warping took patience but it all came together nicely. 
      Having a large working table and clamps was a blessing.  
      I chose to mill out slots for the rungs in the side rails. This helped alignment and made welding everything together much easier. 
      The rungs I cut were 13.25 inches long but the side rail to side rail distance was kept at 12 inches, meaning 1.25 inches were hidden inside the side rails.
      I kept the tolerances tight enough that it held together prior to welding everything up. 
      The last item on the legend is the bottom bracket which you can see in the picture below I took from underneath the van. 
    </p>

      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center mt-2">Bottom Plate for mounting ladder</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      You can see the wheel to the left in the picture as the ladder is right in front of the back wheels. 
      The trim fades out right before this spot making this a great choice for ladder location.
      There are five screws holding the plate onto the van. The three screws on the top row and the two screws through the perpendicular sheet metal. 
      I had to drill the three holes in the top row. I set plus nuts in all five holes, the two on the perpendicular sheet metal you can see.
      I've never had a screw back out of a plusnut before, but for added peace of mind on the perpendicular screws, I added nylon locknuts. 
      The bottom row of three screws (which are really four screws, one is just hidden behind the welded perpendicular piece) are screws which attach the ladder to the bottom plate. 
    </p>

    <p>
      All that was left to do was attach the ladder to the bottom plate and roof rack. Tada!

  <h3 id="WindowCoverDetails">Window Cover Details</h3>
  <p>
    I looked around for window covers and found aesthetically appealing options but with high price tags and unacceptable lead times so I ended up making some myself. 
    My design requirements were that they fold for easy storage, are quick to put up and take down, and provide heat transfer resistance similar to the rest of my van.
    I didn't have any sewing experience but the internet quickly got me up to speed.
    The one design decision that the internet couldn't answer for me was the relative importance of reflective insulation (Low-E, reflectix, etc.). 
    If you look around, most window covers are built either using fabric on both sides or fabric on one side and reflective insulation on the other.
    I ran a quick experiment and found that I needed the reflective insulation but I didn't like the look of it in a sewn window shade. So I made two sets. 
    More on the experiment later. 
  </p>

    <figure class="figure-img">
      <img class="img-fluid singleArticlePicture" " src="/images/windowcovers.jpg" alt="Fabric and reflective window shade sets for 2020 Ford Transit">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center mt-2">Fabric and reflective window shade sets for 2020 Ford Transit</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
  <p>
    One set is just reflective insulation and the other is 1/2" XPS rigid foam board slats stitched into 8.7 oz ripstop polyester.
    The two polyester side window covers have magnets stitched around the perimeter and attach to the metal van frame. 
    The front polyester cover uses the van visors to hold itself in place. 
    The reflective insulation covers were cut to wedge in between the lips around the windows and hold themselves up.
    I'm not sure what that object is in my front windshield but my reflective cover goes around that while my fabric cover sits behind it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I felt the best way to start was by cutting the passenger side window reflective insulation. 
    I saw a few different ways to mark up the outline scientifically but they seemed to take a day or two just to get started and ain't no one got time for that.
    I made a rough oversize outline cut and slowly whittled away the edges until I got a nice snug fit. Success!
    Made a quick copy and then moved on to the front. 
    Coming off a quick success, I was too cocky on the front. Whittled too much on all four of the sides.
    Rather than start over, I just used aluminum tape and taped on parts where it was too small. It gets the job done. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I used the reflective window shades as templates then measured add-on factors at various points to get my outline for the fabric cuts.
    I took into account both the additional area that would need to be covered by the fabric as they need to overlap the metal/plastic around the window and the lost length due to 1/2" inserts in both the x and y directions.
    I bought a handful of sewing supplies and the tailer's chalk was awesome. The one I got had a waxy component that kept everything clean, unlike typical chalk.
    My fabric of choice was OTTERTEX 8.7oz Polyester Ripstop (PU) Fabric in black. I marked the outlines and cut the 6 pieces of fabric. 
    The sewing machine I used was a little overwhelming at first. 
    It had somewhere around 30 stitch types and needles with sizes that you needed a scanning electron microscope to see.
    Long story short, the basic stitch is great and any reasonably sized needle would have gotten the job done. 
    I'll do a lot better at battle of the sexes now that I know about bias tape, hemming, machine basting, and bobbins.
  </p>

  <p>
    When it came to actually sew the covers, I used pins to hold the two sides together and stitched three of the sides together. 
    The thread was standard COATS All-Purpose Polyester Thread. 
    Tried sewing without pins and it sucked. Use pins. 
    I stitched two vertical lines between each future XPS panel with enough space so it would fold neatly while also minimizing the area without insulation. 
    Then I cut the XPS to fit each cavity, making an effort to have a tight fit to keep the cover from having too much extra fabric hanging around. 
    I went with XPS because it was more rigid than reflective insulation (which most builds I saw used) and it has a materially higher R-value than reflective insulation.
    The middle slat needed to be slightly shorter than his surrounding friends because my headliner sticks out a bit there. 
    Once all the slats were in, I sewed up the remaining side. 
    For the front window, it is held up mostly with friction from the middle slat with my headliner but I also flip the visors down for additional support. 
    No need for magnets on that one so I trimmed up the edges a bit and then sewed on 1 inch polyester bias tape around the edges. Ahh, first sewing project done. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The side fabric covers have three sides (left, top and right) with exposed metal while the bottom plastic lip isn't useful. 
    I tested out a handful of magnets and liked the 12 x 6 x 3 mm Neodymium bar magnets best. I used six per window, 12 total. 
    They are roughly evenly spaced around the window. I get nervous opening and closing the doors, but so far, they haven't fallen off yet. 
    I stitched the magnets into little pouches to keep them from moving around in the window covers. 
  </p>

    <figure class="figure-img">
      <img class="img-fluid singleArticlePicture" " src="/images/magnetpouch.jpg" alt="Magnets stitched into pouches, awaiting sewing into window covers">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center mt-2">Magnets stitched into pouches, awaiting sewing into window covers</figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <p>
      Those little pouches were placed in between the edges, then that was placed inside the bias tape, and then, everything sewn together. 
      The feed dogs on my sewing machine were magnetic causing the sewing machine to get hung up but by the third time I caught on and gave it some extra incentive to keep moving.
      Once done sewing in the magnets, all that was left was to test. They fit better than I deserved!
    </p>

    <p>
      I mentioned the rationale for having two sets of window shades being an experiment I ran because I couldn't find any data on the internet (which doesn't mean it's not out there!).
      Experiment is probably too generous, more like five-minute setup with spare parts that give an indication of what the right answer is likely to be. 
      It involved storage boxes, a big sheet of glass, reflective insulation, and an old workout shirt.
    </p>

    <figure class="figure-img">
      <img class="img-fluid singleArticlePicture" " src="/images/windowcovertestsetup.jpg" alt="Setup to test the importance of reflective insulation for window coverings">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center mt-2">Setup to test the importance of reflective insulation for window coverings</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Around 8:00 AM on a cloudless, Spring day in Texas, I set three storage boxes out in an open field and dropped a temperature monitor in each one. 
      I then covered two with reflective insulation and one of those two, I covered further with a garment made out of black polyester.
      I then lugged a large sheet of glass that was just slightly too large for my wingspan to the boxes and set it on top. 
      I know, the experiment is terrible and there are lots of issues. 
      What is the impact of gaps? Will shadows affect results? What about the side incident rays? I had to leave improvements for future experimenters, right?
      Fast forward ~10 hours or so and at dusk, I went to retrieve the max temperature data and clean up. 
      The uncovered glass storage box maxed out at 88F, the polyester covered reflective insulation storage box maxed out at 82F and the reflective insulation storage box maxed out at 75F.
      Sewing one side of a window shade with reflective material didn't sound beautiful or fun so I didn't consider that an option.
      For me, I spend a lot of time in hot climates and the additional thermal control of reflective insulation is worth the tradeoff of carrying another set of window covers.

  <h3 id="SolarPanelTesting">Solar Panel Testing</h3>

  <figure class="figure-img">

    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center mt-2">Roof view of Zac's 2020 Ford Transit in the Warehouse</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Near the back of my van are four 100W solar panels. 
    When I purchase products, I probably spend more time than most searching around looking for the best value. 
    With the rise of globalization, foreign brands represent a high risk, high reward proposition.
    That is, the prices are lower, but there is also a greater chance of getting a bad or misrepresented product.
    And if you get a bad product or have warranty issues, good luck getting service unless you have an American intermediary (Amazon, Mastercard, etc.) to put pressure on the seller. 
    As someone with testing capabilities and time, I generally think the risk is worth taking. Not to mention I usually learn a lot in the process.
    The only other major foreign product risk I took with my van build was using CHINS Lithium-Ion batteries.
    It appears that the internet's experience with CHINS Lithium-Ion batteries mirrors my experience with the HQST solar panels.
    This would lead me to theorize that highly-rated foreign brands tend to overstate their specs and capabilities, but if you can handle the downsides, it represents the best value.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most appealing property of the HQST solar panels was their dimensions. 
    They would fit perfectly on my roof rack without getting shaded as all the other 100W solar panel options were slightly larger by an inch or two and would catch a little shade.
    This either meant HQST's efficiency was higher than anyone else's or they were disingenuous about their power output. 
    My limited understanding of solar panel manufacturing is that most panels come from similar factories using similar technologies so different efficiencies are unlikely. 
    If you took the efficiency of reputable brands and the area of the HQST solar panels, you ended up around 90W for the HQST solar panels. 
    I don't remember the specifics on pricing, but I remember them being a good value even at 90% of rated power output. 
    Feeling like it was my best option, I pulled the trigger and ordered the panels. 
  </p>

  <p>
    My standard operating practice with questionable products or anything that makes me feel uneasy is to test it.
    I generally spend sufficient time and money doing this that the good value actually ends up being a worse value than just buying the reputable product. 
    I think it's the Sherlock Holmes aspect of understanding a mystery that keeps me going back. 
    I had a quick look over the specs on the back of the solar panel and carried it out into the open field to test the open-circuit voltage.
    The listed open-circuit voltage (Voc) on the product is 21.6V. The actual Open Circuit Voltage (Voc) was >23.80V. Not a good start. 
    If I remember correctly, I tested one more panel and found the same result. I assumed the other two would have been the same, but should have confirmed. Bad Zac. This introduces ~3% error. 
    HQST was fairly responsive but over the course of ten emails or so, they first denied they had a problem, then claimed they had a random assortment of panels with various specs and couldn't guarantee any particular specs, then reluctantly agreed to send out an insufficient number of parts to alleviate the issue caused by the voltage issue.  
    Not very helpful. Shortly after our exchanges, I did notice that their online material got updated with the new specs so that was good.  
    The voltage issue was manageable but annoying as I had planned on a 4S (all in series) configuration, but with the increased voltage, had to change to a 2S2P setup as the voltage would have exceeded my charge controllerâ€™s ratings. 
  </p>

  <p>
    With a configuration decided, I installed the panels and prepared for an output test.
    I have a WS-2000 weather station that measures temperature and solar radiance.
    Being mostly naive on air mass, I assumed that a restricted test window from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM would be the same or better than the 1.5 standard condition. 
    I have a Victron SmartSolar Charger MPPT 100/50 with efficiency >98% and made a conservative estimate for line losses of 3%. 
    In March 2022 from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, the solar panels output 1,040 Wh, while their expected output was 1,130 Wh. 
    That is 92% of the expected output and roughly in line with the efficiency of other solar panels on the market.

  <p>
    Overall, I think the HQST 100W solar panels are fairly valued but the incorrect technical specs were a safety issue. 
    In my case, the size was a crucial factor and HQST was accurate on the dimensions.

  <p>
    I have always assumed that all granite countertops were made in huge factories with lots of fancy equipment.
    How else could all those edges look so nice and straight? I just never put my face close enough to see all the imperfections.   
    Inspired by my new knowledge, my need for countertops, and access to scrap granite, I embarked on the project.
  </p>

  <p>
    A family friend has a sign business and was kind enough to donate some scrap granite.
    He also had an employee who had worked on granite signs and was willing to lend me a hand. 
    I took care of sizing and locating cutouts and he made the cuts with a wet tile saw and in the case of the faucet, a wet core bit.
    I wouldn't say his accuracy was anything extraordinary, but he was diligent about cutting on the correct side of the line.
    It's easy to sand down extra granite but not so easy to reattach it. Sadly, I lost the helper at this stage and was on my own for cleaning it up and polishing.

  <p>
    The first order of business was to clean up the corners. I found a diamond finger bit with the same radius as the corners and it worked perfectly.
    Next came polishing. I used a variable speed wet polisher with grits ranging from 50 to 3000.
    I used flexible pads but getting into those tight corners was still a nightmare. 
    I should have practiced on some scrap but instead dove headfirst into polishing. 
    This was a mistake as I had no sense for what grit was needed and for how long. 
    This caused me to spend too little time on certain grits and waste too much time on others with the final result being an ugly, unpolished edge full of scratches.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Frustrated, I called a halftime break and did some more research to find out what I was missing. Turns out, there was no secret, my execution was just bad. 
    Going back to the granite, I started paying attention more and slowly developed an understanding of which grit was required to deal with a specific imperfection. 
    In about half of the time it took me on my first pass, I had the granite shining on all sides. 
    For the sink, a bead of silicone caulk sealed the lip and I decided to go with sink clips as backup mounted with heavy-duty epoxy. 
    The sink is still attached and it hasn't rained in the cabinet yet!

  <h3 id="ShorePowerOutlet">Shore Power Outlet</h3>

  <p>
    Shore power was a required part of my build but I refused to install a connection point anywhere that was visible on my camper. 
    This makes access slightly less convenient but well worth the aesthetic benefit in my opinion. 
    The location I chose was underneath the van on the passenger side D pillar.
    Ford gives you two precut holes there, both with rubber plugs. 
    I left the larger one open for makeup air and modified the smaller one to be a shore power connection point. 
  </p>

    <p>
      I bought an electrical socket that was smaller than the rubber plug so I could mount it inside the rubber plug while still getting the sealing benefits of the plug.
      The next trick was deciding how to attach it. 
      I have an aversion to drilling into the van directly so I chose to make a wood backer board that would squeeze itself and the rubber plug to the van metal, holding the socket in place. 
      Getting the screws to bite the wood backboard was a small trial of patience as I couldn't hold the backboard down well as the backside is not easily accessed.
      Running the electrical lines up the D pillar required grommets and a protective sheath. 
      You can't see it in the picture, but there is a sheet metal barrier with holes in between the two holes in the D pillar.
      I used three separate holes through the barrier, one for each wire, with a grommet protecting each. 
      Where the wires exit the D pillar, there is also a grommet. 
      All the wires are sheathed in insulative material and grouped with automotive tape. 
      I wired a typical house outlet near my main electrical system and that feeds all my equipment when shore power is active.
