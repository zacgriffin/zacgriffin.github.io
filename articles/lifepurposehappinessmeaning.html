  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    Life has been on Earth for 3.7 billion years with the sole purpose of replication. 
    It wasn’t until the last million years that humans developed the capability to challenge this narrative. 
    For modern humans, the purpose of life is to pursue happiness while not infringing on another’s pursuit of the same. 
    Happiness is determined by the equation, Happiness = Genetic Happiness + Life Events + Internal Interpretation of Life Events. 
    The best and only necessary way to live a happy life is by changing how you view the events in your life. 
    To fully maximize happiness, you can also mold the controllable events in your life to pursue meaning. 
    Meaning is individually determined, but some paths are more likely to bring meaning than others. 
    At the highest level, the meaning of modern human life is to make the world a better place.  
    Raising great children, being a devout follower of religion and advancing scientific knowledge are a few examples of possible pursuits to find meaning.
  </p>

  <h3>Life's Purpose</h3>
  <p>
    Life has been around for approximately 3.7 billion years and determining a clear purpose and definition is still evasive. 
    I side with a common definition for life which states life is a thing that grows, reproduces, has functional activity and changes preceding death. 
    By this definition, unicellular life and all of its offspring are alive but not the rock in your backyard, sorry panpsychists. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The first unicellular organism had a simple and straightforward purpose, replicate.  
    It passed this purpose along to all its future offspring which we see in the world today – bacteria, plants and animals. 
    The only life to challenge this narrative has been humans, demonstrating the difficulty of the task. 
    It took us somewhere between 10,000 and 1,000,000 years of exponential, or faster, knowledge accumulation to achieve. 
    Since the first human questioned the purpose of life, many have speculated on the answer through stories, myths, religions and scientific writing. 
  </p>

  <p>Leaning on this historical foundation and my life experience:</p>

  <p style="text-align:center;">
    <b>The purpose of life is to pursue happiness while not infringing on another’s pursuit of the same. </b>
  </p> 

  <h3>Happiness in Life</h3>
  <p>
    I believe happiness comes from the addition of three factors. 
    Your base happiness level determined by genetics, the events which occur in your life and your interpretation of the events which occur in your life. 
    As an equation:
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:center;">
    <b>Happiness = Genetic Happiness + Life Events + Internal Interpretation of Life Events</b> 
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Genetic Happiness</b> - This is your default happiness setting given to you by biology. It’s really just included for technical correctness as it is insignificant compared to the other two factors. No need to think more on this. </li>
    <li><b>Life Events</b> - These are the events in your life. Sleeping, working, going sky diving, church on Sunday, lab work, reading. This is the icing on your happiness cake after you have optimized how you view the events which occur in your life. It’s not necessary to live a happy life, but it can increase your total happiness.</li>
    <li><b>Internal Interpretation of Life Events</b>- This is how you view the events in your life. Is the glass half full or half empty? We will go into detailed examples later. This is the largest and most influential factor to your happiness and the only necessary one to live a happy life. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To become happier, we ignore genetic happiness, maximize happiness from our internal interpretation of life events and only when we are living a happy life, do we focus on changing our life events to max out our happiness. 
    Let’s take a look at each category in this order. 
  </p>

  <h5>Genetic Happiness</h5>
  <p>
    You’re still ignoring this right? 
    To my knowledge, there is no effective way to consistently raise genetically determined happiness without unacceptable side effects. 
    Even if a solution was available, I wouldn’t recommend it. 
  </p>

  <h5>Internal Interpretation of Life Events</h5>

  <p>
    You have complete control over how you interpret events that happen in your life. 
    Is the glass partially full or partially empty? 
    I stick with the former in all circumstances. 
    I have never seen a completely empty glass, so by default, every glass is partially full no matter how horrible it seems.
  </p>

  <p>
    When future events come to pass, your body evaluates the equation, Happiness = Reality - Expectations. 
    If you are really excited for a movie, there is higher chance you are let down when it doesn’t meet your expectations. 
    This creates a rollercoaster of emotions, happy prior to the movie and sad after. 
    Rollercoasters are fun at amusements parks; internal emotional rollercoasters are not. 
    Err on the side of low expectations.  
  </p>

  <p>
    You live in the best time in human history, appreciate it and be thankful.
    Make the most of every opportunity life presents. 
    Give others the benefit of the doubt. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Let’s cover some common examples of ways that you can view events in your life.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Boyfriend dumped you? It can be an opportunity to find a better boyfriend or the end of the world.</li>
    <li>You have terminal cancer and a week to live? You can be thankful and happy for the time you had on Earth or you can be a depressed, miserable wretch.</li>
    <li>Whole Foods out of your gluten-free, open range, non-binary asparagus? For most of human history, people often went hungry and only had the option to eat things that were available. </li>
    <li>Neighbor has a better house? You can spend your whole life chasing others successes or realize that for 300,000 years homo sapiens didn't have the luxury of a permanent dwelling.</li>
    <li>A loved one dies? You can be thankful and happy that person was in your life for as long as they were or you can be sulking couch potato.</li>
    <li>Got fired from your job? That's an opportunity to find a better job or an excuse to lay in bed with a tub of ice cream and makeup running down your face.  </li>
    <li>Annoyed that one of your 6 faucets is broken? You can grumble and complain or be thankful you have still have access to clean, drinking water at your home and not miles away.</li>
    <li>The stranger in the elevator was rude? Maybe the stranger had to bail his 40-year-old son out of jail earlier that day.  </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Find the good in everything, even if it’s hard to see. This is all that is necessary to live a happy life. 
  </p>

  <h5>Life Events</h5>

  <p>
    This includes all the events in life. 
    Any events, past or future, should be identified and analyzed as either controllable or uncontrollable. 
    Most events include a combination of controllable and uncontrollable parts. Influenceable is controllable. 
  </p>

  <p>
    We don't worry about uncontrollable parts, past or future. We accept them. 
    Sometimes they are good, sometimes they are bad. 
    They are what they are. 
    They don't occupy many of our brain cycles unless we can see a realistic path to expand our locus of control to include them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Past controllable parts we learn from. 
    We ruminate, we analyze, then we wipe it from our conscious. 
    We smile to ourselves at an event well handled. 
    We will mess a lot of things up in life but we don't regret. 
    We learn and do better next time. 
    We never mess something up three times. 
    The first time is expected. 
    The second time is frustrating. 
    The third time is unacceptable. 
  </p>

  <p>
    You should influence the controllable, future things in your life around what gives your life meaning. 
    You steer the horse where you want to go. 
    Your choices will either add or subtract to your happiness. 
    I stumbled a lot; I think you will to. 
    The journey is great, and horrible, and totally worth it.
  </p>

  <h3>Meaning in Life</h3>
  
  <p>
    I believe most of the disagreement about the meaning of life occurs because the discussion centers around specific cases of how individuals find meaning.
    At the most fundamental level, I believe:
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:center;">
    <b>The meaning of modern human life is to make the world a better place. </b> 
  </p>


  <p>
    Depending on your developmental stage in life, this desire will stem from different sources. 
    Personally, I feel the desire to make the world a better place out of deference to those who made the life I currently live possible. 
    The better you make the world, the more happiness you will feel. 
    The way you do that, is up to you. 
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Some people want to make the world better by raising great children</li>
    <li>Some people want to make the world better by being exceptional entertainers</li>
    <li>Some people want to make the world better by being a devout follower of religion</li>
    <li>Some people want to make the world better by making businesses and products people love</li>
    <li>Some people want to make the world better by advancing our scientific knowledge</li>
    <li>Some people want to make the world better by making less impact on the earth</li>
    <li>There may even be someone who wants to make the world better by constantly digging and filling in holes in their backyard</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Determining what is meaningful in life is a difficult adventure. My advice would be the following.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You wonder. You try things (that don't permanently affect you. Please don't try drugs or children). You travel and experience new cultures. You see the worlds natural wonders. Be curious. Meet people. Everyone has a superpower.</li>
    <li>You make meaning. You master something. You share your mastery with others. You join clubs and organizations. You advance your craft.</li>
    <li>You pursue knowledge. You read voraciously. You learn history. You ask why. You learn the first principles. You expand your opportunities.</li>
    <li>You work hard. You do the necessary work even if it’s not fun. Everything is done right, and done well.</li>
    <li>Find the suffering that you enjoy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I enjoy making the world a better place through spontaneous acts of kindness, having relationships where the sum is greater than the parts (1+1=3), raising great children, advancing scientific knowledge and making something that people will love. 
    Sleeping, eating and exercising are important supporting functions that allow me to accomplish my life’s meaning. 
    To make this concrete, here are the details of the events I do (and don’t) have in my life.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>I sleep roughly nine hours a night. I tried less, doesn’t work for me. I had more hours, but accomplished less. I need the nine.</li>
    <li>I consume and expend around 5,000 calories a day. I do roughly one and a half hours of zone two exercise a day. Days I feel good, I move it up to zone four or five. I eat large volumes of bland food. Days I don’t exercise, I don’t perform well during the day. Some of my best ideas occur during exercise.</li>
    <li>I spend the remaining twelve hours learning or working on projects that interest me. The projects vary and depend on circumstances prioritized by their impact to what gives my life meaning.  Sometimes its dating, other times it’s learning physics and other times it’s working at a job.</li>
    <li>I really enjoy spontaneous, small acts of kindness and attempt to seize every opportunity. Smile at the Walmart greeter and say hello. Pick up something someone else drops. Lady has a flat tire in the airport parking lot - I can fix that for you. Family is on the way to the climbing gym - Hold the door, smile and say "Welcome to a place that will rock your world". I enjoy it more than the recipient.</li>
    <li>I don’t spend much money and the things I own, are old, small and crappy. And this makes me happy because it allows me to put more resources on the things that really matter to me.</li>
    <li>I don't socialize often. I can’t tell you what’s happening in pop culture, politics or on Oprah. And this makes me happy because it allows me to put more resources into the things that really matter to me.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The things you find meaningful may overlap with mine, or they may not. 
    And it’s this fact that allows for all the beauty in the world. Some people build machines, others are artists. 
    Find something you want to contribute to the world and make it happen.
