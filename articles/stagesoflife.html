  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    I split my life into five distinct stages. Each stage is identified by what is done and why it is done.  
    In the first three stages, I mimicked those around me and I did it for outside validation.
    I spent too long in these stages of life and hope to keep my future children from a similar fate.
    In the last two stages, I charted my own course and I did it for internal validation. 
    The transition from externally to internally validated significantly improved my quality of life.
    I was slow to progress in life but happy with where I ended up.
    My commitments are to have relationships where 1+1=3, raise great children, advance human knowledge and make products people love.  
    I don't foresee an additional stage after 5 but I'm hopefully far from the finish line with plenty of time to learn.
  </p>

  <h3>The Stages of Life</h3>
  <p>
    Life can be sliced and diced as many ways as an onion, but thankfully without the lachrymators. 
    My preferred method of slicing is based on actions and the reasons behind those actions. 
    I like this choice as it reveals an individual's incentives, and therefore their actions. 
    Everyone travels through these stages at a different pace.
    Some people reach the last stage early in life, some never pass the halfway mark. 
    Transitions between stages are usually grey, not black and white.
    In my experience, the first three stages are externally driven by biology and society.
    This made me comfortable in listing the approximate ages I would expect those to occur.
    The last two stages are internally driven and I would expect them to be highly variable.
    I left these ages blank.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="ResList"><b>Stage 1 (Ages 0 - 6)</b> - Mimicry without purpose within guidance given by parents</li>
    <li class="ResList"><b>Stage 2 (Ages 6 - 11)</b> - Mimicry for approval/validation from parents</li>
    <li class="ResList"><b>Stage 3 (Ages 11 - ?)</b> - Mimicry for approval/validation from peers</li>
    <li class="ResList"><b>Stage 4 (Ages ? - ?)</b> - Self-discovery</li>
    <li class="ResList"><b>Stage 5 (Ages ?+)</b> - Commitment</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I never considered my progression through life until I was around 30 years old.
    I was lucky and ended up in a reasonable place, but would highly recommend a more planned approach in the next life.
    Many unnecessary years were spent in Stage 3 and my transition to Stage 4 was slow and oscillating. 
    I don't foresee a Stage 6, or a dip back into Stage 4, but time will tell.

  <h3>Stage 1</h3>
  <p>
    Stage 1 starts with birth and ends around the time you enter elementary school, ~6 years old in the United States.
    During this time, biology is driving them to mimic the external world without purpose within guidance given by their parents. 
    I claim this is without purpose as I don't have any reliable memories of this period in my life. Maybe someone out there does?
    My parents have shown me pictures and home videos and I think those are mostly responsible for the small number of things I think I remember from that time.
    As far as I know, my childhood was awesome.
    Loving, caring, present parents with enough money to live but not enough to be spoiled. 
    Beaches, dancing, sandboxes.
  </p>

  <h3>Stage 2</h3>
<p>
    Most kids are in Stage 2 during their elementary years. 
    During this time, biology is driving them to mimic the external world with approval and validation from their parents.
    I began to have my first memories around first grade and my life revolved around my mother's approval.
    Some of my first memories were being tired in the one-mile run during PE and having a crush on the girl with the pink pencil box.
    I used to write her name on the foggy shower wall because that was way more practical than talking to her.
    Mom heard about my mile time, but not my crush, that was too embarrassing. 
    I played sports during elementary and my desire to my make parents proud gave me some material anxiety.

<h3>Stage 3</h3>
<p>
    Stage 3 roughly begins when kids enter Junior high.
    I would hypothesize that biology still drives the mimicking actions but society plays the major role in the transition from parental approval to peer approval. 
    The societal factors that come to mind are the ones that allow autonomy like after-school sports, class selection, and a self-directed hallway.
    I think these factors reduce the kids dependence on the parent and drive them to mimic their peers. 
    At the start of Junior high, I was probably still more of a parental approval kid and the transition to peer approval was gradual over the course of Junior High. 
    I noticed my strongest desire for peer approval during lunch. 
    I'm not sure why it mattered so much to me but it was a daily referendum on my cool status.
    Sadly, I never seemed to make the cut. 
    Being in Stage 3 during Junior High is not necessarily enjoyable, but I think it's the optimal time to get that experience.
    The main downside for me was anxiety. 
</p>

<p>
    High school is when my desire for peer approval came out in full force.
    The peers I deemed the most desirable were the jocks. Not a good choice.
    High school introduces sex, driving, drugs, and sports visibility among many other firsts. 
    Not the ideal time to be mimicking the jocks based on what you believe will increase your social standing. 
    I was stuck in stage 3 through high school but knew a few classmates who were already in Stage 4. 
    How nice it would have been to make those mistakes exploring life rather than looking for validation from others.
    This is likely a really hard problem to solve, but I will do all that I can to help my children be in Stage 4 during high school. 
    Establish deep trust and offer insight while leaving the decision to them? Handling kids is going to be a challenge.
</p>

<p>
    College was mostly a Stage 3 experience for me with very little Stage 4 thinking. 
    In terms of enjoyment, most came from my Stage 4 decisions and very little from the Stage 3 ones. 
    I was still driven for high social status among my peers during college, but I had mainly chosen an intellectual peer group this time. 
    In hindsight, that was a great decision but I was still making choices for the wrong reasons. 
    I would estimate that another handful of classmates passed to Stage 4 during this period, but mostly hung out in Stage 3. 
</p>

<p>
  My professional career after college was spent chasing financial success for the world to validate how great I was. 
  It was an oscillating, but fairly linear, path from Stage 3 to Stage 4 throughout my twenties.
  By my 30th trip around the sun, I had achieved financial success.
  I walked outside my front door, put my hands in the air, and announced that I had arrived financially. 
  You know what? No one cared. Life wasn't any different.
  I had climbed Maslow's hierarchy and achieved my life's goal. But I still had time left. What to do now?
  Enter self-discovery.

<h3>Stage 4</h3>

<p>
  My life entered pure self-discovery at 30. I think people usually refer to this as a midlife crisis. 
  Although mine wasn't much of a crisis as I didn't have anything that could light my hair on fire. 
  No external pressures, no commitments, and no chain holding me to my office chair.
  I thought. I picked up new hobbies. I explored. I traveled. I read. I learned a lot about myself and the world. 
  A few months into this journey, I had the sad realization that I couldn't do everything. There just wasn't enough time in one lifetime.
  And the life-extension folks don't seem very credible.
  Shortly after realizing this, I had the epiphany that Mark's book The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*** tried to tell me this many years ago. 
  I will never claim to be fast, but I generally end up in the right spot. 
</p>

<p>
  I spent so much time oscillating in and out of stage 4 during my twenties I didn't need much time in Stage 4. 
  By 31, I felt like I had cobbled together enough learnings to build a foundation and commit to it.
  I felt comfortable doing this as I had tested all the other foundations and didn't like them. 
  I had finally become an architect for my life and started to live intentionally. 
</p>

<h3>Stage 5</h3>

<p>
  Ah, the end game. The point in life where you get to be happy with yourself and your direction in life.
  You get to spend the rest of your time working towards the commitments you set for yourself. 
  At the very top, my main commitment is to make myself happy. The way I achieve happiness is by making the world a better place. 
  To make the world a better place I have relationships where 1+1=3, raise great children, advance human knowledge and make products people love. 
  Those four items guide my life and shape how I choose to spend my time. 
  The tradeoffs I make to pursue these goals make me happy, but are off-putting to most. 
  I don't spend much money and I own old, crappy things. 
  I don't socialize often and can't tell you anything about pop culture, politics, or the best TV shows.
  This is the way I choose to live, but definitely not the common path. 
  If you want to know if someone is in Stage 5, ask them to list the things they happily sacrifice. 
</p>

<p>
  I like my commitments as they can be chipped away at on a daily basis, will ultimately outlast me, and allow for flexibility. 
  I think these characteristics are necessary for a life-long commitment but this softness may be unattractive to some.
  I don't foresee an additional stage after 5 but then again, I'm hopefully far from the finish line with plenty of time to learn.
