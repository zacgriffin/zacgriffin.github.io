  <p> Welcome to my small slice of the internet! I am a curious and hardworking engineer stumbling through life trying to make the world a better place.
    This website is where I get to share my thoughts and experiences with the hope that it will improve the lives of others. 
  </p>

  <p>Distilling the first 30 years of my life into a few paragraphs is a tough challenge.
    The pinnacles, nadirs and the in-betweens can be found on the <a href="about.html">About</a> page.</p>

  <p>The <a href="articles.html">Articles</a> page gives me a chance to share a thoughtful view about a specific topic. 
    This section will likely be sparse until I finish wrapping up my current obligations. </p>

  <p>I’ve read a few good books in my short time on this beautiful green Earth and would argue that they have been the single largest contributing factor to who I am today. 
    You can find many of the books I have read with occasional notes on the <a href="books.html">Books</a> page.</p>
  
    <p>I've also come across a fair number of good resources. 
    You can find links to these resources along with some sparse notations on the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.</p>
