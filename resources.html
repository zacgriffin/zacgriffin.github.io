<h2>Resources Overview</h2>
<p> This page contains a list of things that have had an outsized influence on my life. Some of which are well documented, and some of which are woefully inadequate. 
I have only sampled a very small and specific subset of the entire universe so please keep that in mind.

<h2>Resource List</h2>

<p></p>

<h3>Podcasts</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li class="ResList">
<p><a href="https://lexfridman.com/podcast/" target="_blank">The Lex Fridman Podcast by Lex Fridman</a>- I really appreciate Lex’s humble personality, curiosity and intelligence.

</li>
<li class="ResList">

Due to podcast length, it usually just touches on the high and low points of the journey without material depth</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Educational Resources</h3>
<p>Access to free courses from elite universities is one of the best things to happen to the world.

  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Richard Feynman Lectures on Physics</a> was a colorful physicist widely regarded as a great in his field.

</ul>

<h3>Collection of Websites</h3>
<p>Every once and a while I end up on a website that has a big impact on me. 
  I don't necessarily expect these to have a big impact on you.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> - Is a great resource for ideas and news. An offspring of Paul Grahams. I usually check every other day or so.</li>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/" target="_blank">Paul Graham</a> - Is the hacker and nerd behind Y Combinator and Hacker News. His essays offer great perspectives on life.</li>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://www.principles.com/" target="_blank">Ray Dalio</a> - Thoughtful CEO of Bridgewater Associates. Great resource for life principles and economic history. Watch the animated videos and read the books.</li>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://markmanson.net/" target="_blank">Mark Manson</a> - Mark has written a handful of popular books and has a long list of articles on his website. I developed many of my fundamental principles from other sources, but the handful of articles I have read on his website were consistent with my world view, albeit without such a sharp edge and potty mouth. I would recommend the The Four Stages of Life as one that I found insightful.</li>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://www.lynalden.com/" target="_blank">Lyn Alden</a> - Independent economic analyst with detailed and data driven reports.</li>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://ciechanow.ski/" target="_blank">Bartosz Ciechanowski</a> - One of the most beautiful, detailed and interactive websites I have every come across. Bartosz gets interested in a topic and then makes it simple and beautiful for the rest of us.</li>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://www.wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/recent/" target="_blank">Chris Baird</a> - Physics professor who teaches scientific principles that are commonly misunderstood or unintuitive. My personal favorite is how projectors project the color black (which is the absence of light). How many people have looked at a projector and never wondered this?</li>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://dinosaurtheory.net/" target="_blank">David Esker</a> - One of the first personal websites I happened upon. Introduced me to the square-cube law. Made me think about the fact that everything in the world has to be logical and make sense.</li>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://legend.octopuslabs.io/sample-page.html" target="_blank">R4ndom’s Software Cracking (Reverse Engineering) Tutorials</a> - My first real foray into low level programming languages and understanding the power of first principles thinking. </li>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://sci-hub.se/" target="_blank">Sci-hub</a> - The best current resource for academic papers and research. </li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Campervan</h3>
<p>I wanted the freedom to conveniently live, work and play anywhere in the US and I felt the best way to have location independence was by building out a camper van. 
  I gave myself the dual mandate of building out a van with all the conveniences of a house while also being capable of running off the grid for more than a week.
Here were some of my top resources.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://faroutride.com/" target="_blank">FarOutRide</a> - My go to resource for campervan items. They really crushed the documentation of a modern campervan. They will get you through 90%+ of a build. Click around their entire website as it's filled with gems.</li>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://www.vanlifeoutfitters.com/" target="_blank">Vanlife Outfitters</a> - I purchased a few parts from their website and utilized a few blog posts for ideas. They had the best camper van air conditioner write up at the time. I also appreciated his shower build. </li> 
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://www.campervantraveler.com/" target="_blank">Camper Van Traveler</a> - Website where Dan hosts information related to his conversion. I found Dan's shower build insightful.</li>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://www.thefitrv.com/" target="_blank">The Fit RV</a> - I desperately wanted noise data on the Coleman Mach 10 NDQ and James came through. He also has a video of replacing a roof top AC unit.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Financial Independence</h3>
<p>It wasn't until roughly halfway through my working career that a colleague mentioned financial independence and got me thinking about my long-term goals and life trajectory. 
  A community exists around the idea and they have some views which I think everyone could benefit from implementing. 
  The two most memorable resources I used are listed below but many more exist.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/" target="_blank">Mr Money Mustache</a> - One of the classics for financial independence and early retirement</li>
  <li class="ResList"><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/" target="_blank">Mad Fientist</a> - Great podcast and great tax advice. I never understood tax advantaged vehicles well until reading his explanations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ironman</h3>
<p>I was just about to do my first marathon when the idea to do an Ironman came up.
  Rather than giving it proper thought, I just signed up for a race in 3 months and figured I could iron out the details later.
  How hard could it be? 
  As it turns out, you should train for 6 months or more and unless you have an endurance background, you also need to spend a lot of time learning.  </p>
<ul>
  <li class="ResList">Be Iron Fit by Don Fink and Melanie Fink was the only resource I used for training. It will give you a great foundation but I wish I would have researched and learned more.</li>
  <li class="ResList">After the marathon, I had 14 weeks to train for the Ironman. Training peaked at 25 hours/week. Never have I ever consumed so many calories and still lost weight.</li>
  <li class="ResList">I would highly recommend everyone do a full Ironman, it is extremely rewarding on so many levels. I would also recommend you do more homework and prepare for longer than I did!</li>
</ul>

<h3>International Travel</h3>
<p>I did a poor job documenting most of my international trips but I did keep a list of the cities I visited and some of the main attractions in each city. 
  Most of my research was amalgamated from manual internet searches. 
  It would be great if someone would program an automated trip planner, all the necessary components exist.  </p>
