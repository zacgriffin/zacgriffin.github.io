  <p>I started off life by winning the birth lottery. I was born to middle-class parents who showered me with love and gave me all the opportunities to succeed in life. 
    It’s really hard to admit that for the first 18 years of my life, I almost wasted all of my potential (evidenced by the haircut choice). 
    It wasn’t malicious, it wasn’t intentional, I just wanted to be cool and I derived everything in my life - values, actions, thoughts, activities - from the cool kids. 
    In my eyes, this required me to treat my peers poorly, party like Project X, never try hard at anything, and disrespect authority. 
    To further hinder my progress in life, I burned thousands of hours on video games. 
    On the bright side, I spent so many hours running around the football and soccer fields in the Texas summer heat that fourteen-hour workdays paled in comparison. 
    I squandered so many great opportunities early in life trying to be cool.  Don’t be like me.  Can we save the future from making the same mistakes?</p>


  <p>Having graduated high school, society listed college as the next logical step so that's what I did. 
    The only problem was that no one was telling me where to go, so for the first time in my life, I had to make an important decision.
    I completely botched the decision-making process but on the positive side, I had finally started the transition to self-discovery.
    The most rewarding experiences I had in college outside the standard curriculum involved organizations, research, extra courses outside my major, volunteering, and intramurals.
    Intermixed with these good choices, I continued to treat people poorly, made more than my fair share of poor decisions, and missed so many great opportunities.
    I apologize to all those I treated poorly.
    Becoming autonomous is the start of a beautiful, painful, confusing, and rewarding journey as you explore all the possible ways to live. </p>

  <p>After graduation, I spent eight years working in the energy sector getting a wide range of experiences.
    I worked at both large and small operating companies producing oil and gas, startups making new technology, and on the financial side valuing assets. 
    I had slowly progressed my programming knowledge since my college research days and I spent roughly seventy percent of my working time on standard petroleum engineering work and the rest on programming projects.
    I generally worked ten-hour days, seven days a week, and spent the remaining hours exercising and trying to determine the right way to live. 
    Figuring out life has been a long journey with many steps in both directions, but a totally worthwhile investment. </p>

  <p>I took a break from the corporate world in 2021 to spend some time on long-overdue projects.
    The most notable of these were remodeling a house, building a camper van, and studying financial history.
    Having completed the projects in early 2022, I currently spend my time trying to make the world a better place. 
    I think the best path for me to achieve this is through building something people love, having great children, and advancing scientific knowledge.
    And so the next phase of my journey begins.</p>
