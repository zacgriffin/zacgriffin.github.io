  <h2>Article Overview</h2>

  <p>
    As I wander through life, I occasionally come across or create things that I think could benefit others but require more details than my resources page.
    This is where I plan to house those items. 
    I don't want this to be a repeat of other things already on the internet and will do my best to only extend what is already available. 
    I have a fairly strong aversion to articles attempting to influence the reader and hope to succeed in my vision to merely inform.
  </p>

      <p class="ArticleDate">April 25, 2022</p>
      <p class="ArticleText">
        I have been reflecting on my life journey recently and wanted to write about my experience. 
        I see human life developing through five distinct stages, each stage separated by a change in incentives. 
        Stage 1 is biological driven mimicry, stage 2 is parental driven mimicry, stage 3 is peer driven mimicry, stage 4 is self-discovery and stage 5 is commitment. 
        The first two stage transitions are mostly biologically driven with the last two stage transitions being mostly intellectually driven. 
        The transitions are usually gradual over time and people can be in multiple stages at once. 
        Future generations should focus on transitioning to stage 4 prior to entering high school and being comfortably in stage 5 before entering a lifelong relationship. 
        These will be difficult but worthwhile goals.

      <p class="ArticleDate">April 18, 2022</p>
      <p class="ArticleText">
        After finishing a house remodel around Q2 2021, I finally got around to building out my 2020 Ford Transit. 
        The internet covered most of the heavy lifting as it had been accumulating modern camper van builds since roughly 2006. 
        FarOutRide, bless their souls, provides an amazing resource at the best possible price, free.
        Check them out for build details and please use their affiliate links when possible! 
        Always enjoying a challenge, I required that my build have all the conveniences of a house while also being off-grid capable for over a week.
        The van is roughly 90% complete. I'm holding off on trim and finish until it's had enough field testing to ensure no major changes are needed.
        We'll start off with a quick van tour then touch on a few of the build details.
